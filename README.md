# Technical interview assignments for security engineer position at Epidemic Sound

The structure of the report is as follows:
- Task_1 folder: solution for task 1 which includes: Dockerfile, docker-compose file, configuration files (TLS certificates, apache configuration) and explanation how to use the tool.
- Task_2 folder: writeup for security assessment report of task 2.

***Note: since I could only spend limited time on the assignments, only the main ideas are included in the report. I expect to discuss more ideas in greater detail in the technical interview session.***
