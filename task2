1. SQL Injection (High)
a. Description
The music search page has a SQL Injection vulerability. When user input a search string, the web application creates SQL query string by concatenating the search string with predefined SQL query.

```
$keyword = $_GET["keyword"];
$query = "SELECT name,description,author from songs where name LIKE '%" + $keyword + "'";
```
By sending a malicious keyword, attackers can modify the SQL query string to extract data from other tables. For example, if attackers send the string 0000' UNION SELECT username, password, email from users ' # then the query string will become
SELECT name,description,author from songs where name LIKE '%00000' UNION SELECT username, password, email from users 
b. Impact
Malicious attackers can extract data from the database and can control the server by uploading a shell into the server.
c. Solution
Use prepared statement instead
2. Cross site scripting
3. Command injection
5. Use of vulerable software
6. Privilege escalation
